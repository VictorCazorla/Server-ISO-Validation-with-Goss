# GOSS Server ISO Infrastructure Testing

This repository contains a suite of tests and tools for validating server infrastructure ISOs using **GOSS**

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform automated testing on server ISOs to ensure their integrity, compatibility, and reliability before deployment in production environments.

## Repository Structure

- **tests/**  
  Contains all the unit tests written in GOSS format. Each test targets specific aspects of the server infrastructure or ISO validation.

- **Launcher Script**  
  A launcher script aggregates the necessary tests from the TEST folder and executes them. Upon completion, it generates a comprehensive report detailing passed and failed tests.

- **Variables File**  
  This configuration file allows customization of the testing process, such as selecting test types or specific parameters for the ISO environment.

- **GOSS Test File**  
  A centralized GOSS file where all tests are listed and annotated, facilitating test management and execution.

## Usage

1. Configure your testing parameters in the Variables file according to your environment and requirements.
2. Run the launcher script to execute the test suite.
3. Review the generated report to identify any errors or validation results.

## Requirements

- GOSS installed on your system.  
  [Official GOSS Documentation](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss)

- Proper permissions to execute tests on your server infrastructure or ISO environment.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new tests or improve existing ones. Make sure to update the GOSS Test File accordingly.
