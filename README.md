# 🚀 GOSS Server ISO Infrastructure Testing

This repository contains a suite of tests and tools for validating server infrastructure ISOs using **GOSS** 🧪

## 📋 Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform automated testing on server ISOs to ensure their integrity, compatibility, and reliability before deployment in production environments.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **tests/** 🧩  
  Contains all the unit tests written in GOSS format. Each test targets specific aspects of the server infrastructure or ISO validation.

- **Launcher Script** ▶️  
  A launcher script aggregates the necessary tests from the tests folder and executes them. Upon completion, it generates a comprehensive report detailing passed and failed tests.

- **Variables File** ⚙️  
  This configuration file allows customization of the testing process, such as selecting test types or specific parameters for the ISO environment.

- **GOSS Test File** 📄  
  A centralized GOSS file where all tests are listed and annotated, facilitating test management and execution.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Configure your testing parameters in the Variables file according to your environment and requirements.
2. Run the launcher script ▶️ to execute the test suite.
3. Review the generated report 📊 to identify any errors or validation results.

## 📋 Requirements
